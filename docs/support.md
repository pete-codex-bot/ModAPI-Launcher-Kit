### Common troubleshooting steps
- Ensure the Launcher Kit is up-to-date. The latest version is **{{ site.github.latest_release.name }}**.
  - You can check your current version by opening the Easy Uninstaller and looking in the bottom left corner.
  - If you see "Update Check Failed", please see [here](support/update-check-failed).
- If you are getting an error, please look through the list on the left and see if the error is listed.
- Make sure you have a [supported game version](support/game-versions).
- Make sure you don't have any [outdated mods](support/outdated-mods).
- If the game is working but occasionally crashes, see [improving stability](support/improving-stability).

### Get help
If you have tried all of the above and still need help, please prepare the following information:
- Where you got the game from (disc, EA App, Steam, or GOG)

  - Your current mod list
  - Your current game version

You may also be asked to send a support info file:
- Press Win+R and type in `notepad "%appdata%\Spore ModAPI Launcher\support.info"`
